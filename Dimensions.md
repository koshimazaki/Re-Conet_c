* Use Rytm sysex files. 
* Use RytmTool to modulate Rytm internal parameters via MIDI. Use this to taste. 
* Process Rytm with your favourite delay and saturator. I used Bugbrand PT Delay and Looptrotter SATUR-8/24. 
* Use piano samples from the sample pack. Run them thru favourite granular instrument and pitch shift right up to fill the high end of the spectrum. I used Reconetc pd patch and sampled the output with MakeNoise Morphagene.
* Use analog synth or module for low end bass. I used Cwejman BLD2. Use of stereo spring reverbs on top is recommended by Nathan Moody and myself :) 
* automate the effects in your DAW, do several takes and improvised jams are recommended.
