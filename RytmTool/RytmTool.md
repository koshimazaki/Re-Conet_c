## RytmTool ##

Is a Max patch that allows MIDI manipulation of Analog Rytm. It adds additional 10 modulation sources and that can be assigned to any parameter of any voice. It has keyboard and MIDI controller assignable interface from Max4Live object. Software works standalone as I like it like that :)

It can be used with other synths too using NPRN MIDI. Just NPRN text file with appropriate data needs to be loaded. CC MIDI is also possible with slight modification. 
See text file if you need Rytm spec to be loaded somewhere might be needed on its own. MIDI info is taken from [Rytm manual](https://www.elektron.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analog-Rytm-MKII-User-Manual_ENG.pdf).
