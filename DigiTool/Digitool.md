## DigiTool ##

This is DigiTool a Max patch that allows MIDI manipulation of Elektron Digitone. It adds additional 8 modulation sources that can be assigned to any parameter of any voice. 
It can be used with other synths using NPRN MIDI just NPRN text file with appropriate data needs to be loaded. CC MIDI is also possible with slight modification. 
Note modulators have slightly different behaviour and functionality. I used in in several tracks Mornings at Night had the heaviest use of it. Find it great for generation of new sounds or brining more movement to Digitone before I start processing it externally.
