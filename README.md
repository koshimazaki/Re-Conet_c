# Re-Conet_c
Is my attempt to open source album where the entire process of creation is open and accessible to the audience. Including samples, patches, mixes and mastering of the tracks. 
Project includes creation of audio works/tracks as well as sound pack, Max8 patches, [Pure data(pd)](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) patches, [ORCÎ›](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) algorithms, [VCV Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) patches, mixes and mastering of the developed works. 
I also included keymap for Preonic keyboard I have used and sysex files for Elektron Digitone and Analog Rytm. 
High quality files are on [Wave Folder Records Bandcamp](https://wavefolder.bandcamp.com/album/re-conet-c) where all the content is released and hosted as well.
