# Mornings at Night Track #

* Use ORCA sequencing. One of the algorithms from ORCA folder is good starting point. 
* Use DigiTool to modulate Digitone internal parameters via MIDI. Use this to taste. Included is Digitone pattern I have used.
* Use Digitone or other multitimbral synth Monomachine would work well here. Gritty and raw is preferable. I used 4 voices so could be four synths. 
* Generate fair bit of material. I've generated 1h, pick the best bits. 
* Duplicate the 4 tracks and hard pan each duplicated copy. 
* Replace sections of one of the copies with other favourite material from the same jam. This will give variety and texture.
* Rinse everything with your favourite delays. I used Modcan Dual Delay and Bugbrand PTDelay. 
* Use analog synth or module for low end bass. I tracked the bassline with MBC3 and triggered BLD2 with the envelope follwer on low end. 
* Did two takes of two different BLD sounds this way. Kind of two kicks/basslines. It fits well contrasting Digitone's vibe. You can avoid this by using analog synth as part of 4 voices but it worked in my favour here. 
* Jammed with the amount of kicks being triggered using gain knob on MBC3. 
* Chopped up if it you get too much material.
* automate everything, add some effects in your DAW.
