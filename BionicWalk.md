# Bionic Walk Track #

* Use Analog Rytm and Digitone sysex files. 
* Use RytmTool and DigiTool to modulate internal parameters of the machines via MIDI. Use this to taste. 
* Duplicate the Digitone melody tracks and layer that with different sounds generated by the process. This will create thicker sounds. 
* Automate this to taste.
* Process both machines with your favourite delay and saturator. I used Bugbrand PT Delay and Looptrotter SATUR-8/24 and Eventide Space. Do several takes of that. 
* Use of Valhalla reverbs on top is recommended by Roel Funcken and myself :) 
* Automate the effects in your DAW, do several takes and improvised jams are recommended. 
* Multitrack everything using Overbridge or external outs of Rytm and dont send groups and double ups to your mixing engineers as I did ;) 
* Sending raw track will give them more creative freedom and give it new taste. Listen to both versions of Bionic Walk to hear the difference.
